The primordial exploration of GitHub.

Introduction of the writer:
  My name is Peng Lv, from Tsinghua University, major in physics. I wish I can read a lot of books, learn a lot from practice, and finally become more powerful, then I would accomplish my dream, which means helping the weak people and making distribution to human. I believe I will reach it in the future, but it won't be very easy, so I ought to study and work hard.
